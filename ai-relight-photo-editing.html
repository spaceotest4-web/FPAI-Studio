      <h2 id="what-is-relighting">What Is AI Relighting?</h2>
      <p>AI relighting is a technology that analyzes the existing lighting in a photograph and intelligently transforms it to simulate a completely different lighting environment. Unlike traditional brightness and contrast adjustments that uniformly affect the entire image, AI relighting understands the three-dimensional structure of a scene. It knows where surfaces face, how light should wrap around objects, where shadows should fall, and how highlights should behave on different materials.</p>
      <p>The result is remarkably realistic. A portrait taken under harsh midday sun can be transformed to look like it was shot during golden hour. A product photo with flat, uninspiring lighting can be given dramatic studio lighting with precise shadows and highlights. All of this happens without reshooting a single frame.</p>

      <h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases for AI Relighting</h2>

      <h3>Fix Bad Lighting</h3>
      <p>We have all been there: you take what should be a great photo, but the lighting ruins it. Harsh overhead fluorescents flatten a portrait. Direct sunlight creates unflattering shadows across a face. A dimly lit restaurant makes your food photo look unappetizing. AI relighting rescues these shots by replacing the problematic lighting with something far more flattering.</p>

      <h3>Creative Effects</h3>
      <p>Beyond fixing problems, relighting opens up creative possibilities that would normally require expensive lighting equipment. Add neon color gels to a portrait for a cyberpunk aesthetic. Create a moody, low-key look with a single dramatic light source. Simulate the warm, directional light of a sunset streaming through a window. These effects would normally require a full studio setup with multiple lights, gels, and modifiers.</p>

      <h3>Product Photography Enhancement</h3>
      <p>Product images sell products, and lighting is the difference between a product that looks premium and one that looks amateur. AI relighting lets you take a basic product photo and transform it with professional studio lighting: soft, even illumination with gentle shadows that define shape and texture. This is especially valuable for small businesses and e-commerce sellers who cannot afford professional photography for every product.</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use Relighting in FP AI Studio</h2>
      <p>FP AI Studio makes relighting straightforward with just a few steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open FP AI Studio and navigate to the <strong>Image Editing</strong> section</li>
        <li>Select the <strong>Relight</strong> tool from the available editing options</li>
        <li>Provide the URL of the image you want to relight</li>
        <li>Write a <strong>lighting prompt</strong> describing the lighting effect you want (e.g., "warm golden hour sunlight from the left side, soft shadows")</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Process</strong> and wait for the AI to transform your image</li>
        <li>Download or share the result directly from the app</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The AI processes the image in seconds, analyzing the geometry and surfaces in your photo to apply the new lighting in a physically plausible way.</p>

      <h2 id="lighting-styles">Lighting Styles and Effects</h2>
      <p>Here are the most popular lighting styles you can achieve with AI relighting, along with the prompts that produce the best results:</p>

      <h3>Golden Hour</h3>
      <p>The warm, soft, directional light that occurs just after sunrise or before sunset. It is universally flattering for portraits and landscapes. Try: <em>"warm golden hour sunlight, soft directional light from the left, long gentle shadows, warm color temperature."</em></p>

      <h3>Studio Portrait Lighting</h3>
      <p>Clean, professional illumination with controlled shadows. The standard for headshots, portraits, and commercial photography. Try: <em>"professional studio lighting, soft key light from 45 degrees, subtle fill light, clean white background illumination."</em></p>

      <h3>Dramatic / Low-Key</h3>
      <p>High-contrast lighting with deep shadows and selective illumination. Creates mood, mystery, and visual intensity. Try: <em>"dramatic low-key lighting, single hard light source from above right, deep shadows, high contrast, moody atmosphere."</em></p>

      <h3>Neon and Color Gels</h3>
      <p>Colored lighting that bathes the subject in vibrant hues. Popular for music, fashion, and editorial content. Try: <em>"neon lighting, blue and pink color gels, cyberpunk atmosphere, glowing rim lights, dark background."</em></p>

      <h3>Natural Window Light</h3>
      <p>The soft, diffused light that comes through a large window. Produces gentle, natural-looking results with soft shadows. Try: <em>"soft natural window light from the right side, gentle diffused illumination, subtle shadows, airy and bright feel."</em></p>

      <h2 id="before-after">Before and After: What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Understanding what AI relighting can and cannot do helps set realistic expectations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A flat, overcast portrait</strong> becomes a warm, golden-hour lit image with directional light wrapping naturally around facial features, adding depth and dimension that was completely absent in the original.</li>
        <li><strong>A harshly lit product photo</strong> transforms into a professionally lit studio shot with soft, controlled shadows that define the product's shape without creating distracting dark patches.</li>
        <li><strong>A casual indoor snapshot</strong> gains a moody, cinematic quality with dramatic side lighting that creates depth, separating the subject from the background with rim light and shadow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The AI preserves all the details of the original photo: the subject, expression, pose, background elements, and textures. Only the lighting changes, and it changes convincingly because the AI understands the three-dimensional structure of the scene.</p>

      <h2 id="tips-best-results">Tips for the Best Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with a clear, well-exposed photo.</strong> The AI needs to see the details in your image to relight them properly. Very dark or very overexposed images have less information for the AI to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Be specific about direction.</strong> Instead of "nice lighting," specify where the light comes from: "warm light from the upper left" gives the AI clear guidance and produces more natural results.</li>
        <li><strong>Describe the mood, not just the technique.</strong> Prompts like "cozy, intimate, warm evening atmosphere" can be as effective as technical lighting descriptions because the AI understands both artistic and technical language.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine with other editing tools.</strong> After relighting, you can upscale for higher resolution or use style transfer to add an artistic look. Relighting is most powerful as part of a multi-step editing workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with extremes.</strong> Some of the most striking results come from dramatic transformations. Do not be afraid to try neon lighting on a daytime portrait or golden hour effects on an indoor photo.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AI relighting represents one of the most practical applications of generative AI for everyday photography. It solves a problem every photographer faces and makes professional-quality lighting accessible to anyone with a phone.</p>
