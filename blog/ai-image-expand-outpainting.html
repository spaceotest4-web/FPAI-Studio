      <h2 id="what-is-outpainting">What Is Outpainting / Image Expansion?</h2>
      <p>Outpainting, also called image expansion, is an AI technique that extends an image beyond its original borders. Unlike cropping, which removes content, outpainting adds new content that seamlessly continues the existing scene. The AI analyzes the edges of your image, understands the scene context (colors, textures, perspective, lighting, and subject matter), and generates new pixels that naturally extend the composition.</p>
      <p>Think of it like having an artist who can paint beyond the edges of a photograph, imagining what lies just outside the frame and rendering it in perfect continuity with the original image. The sky continues with the same cloud patterns and color gradients. A forest scene extends with trees that match the species, density, and lighting of the original. A studio backdrop seamlessly widens without visible seams or color shifts.</p>

      <h2 id="how-flux-pro">How FP AI Studio Uses Flux Pro for Expansion</h2>
      <p>FP AI Studio's image expansion feature is powered by Flux Pro, one of the most capable AI image models available. Flux Pro's strength in understanding spatial relationships, lighting consistency, and fine detail makes it exceptionally well-suited for outpainting tasks.</p>
      <p>When you submit an image for expansion, Flux Pro analyzes the entire composition: the perspective lines, the light direction and color temperature, the textures and patterns, and the semantic content of the scene. It then generates new content at the edges that matches all of these properties. The result is an expanded image that looks like it was originally captured at a wider angle, not one that was artificially extended.</p>
      <p>You can also provide a text prompt to guide the expansion. For example, if you are expanding a portrait, you might add "continue the background with a blurred garden, bokeh effect" to ensure the extended area matches your creative vision rather than just extrapolating from edge pixels.</p>

      <h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases for Image Expansion</h2>

      <h3>Extend Backgrounds for Banners and Headers</h3>
      <p>This is the most common use case. You have a great photo, but it is the wrong aspect ratio for your banner, website header, or social media cover. Instead of awkwardly cropping or adding plain colored borders, image expansion lets you widen the scene naturally. A portrait-oriented product shot becomes a landscape banner. A square Instagram image becomes a wide website header. The new content blends seamlessly with the original.</p>

      <h3>Fix Cropped Photos</h3>
      <p>Sometimes you realize after the fact that a photo was framed too tightly. Important elements were cut off at the edges: the top of a building, a person's feet, the context of a scene. AI expansion can recover what was lost (or rather, generate a plausible version of it). While the AI cannot know exactly what was outside the original frame, it generates content that makes visual sense in context.</p>

      <h3>Create Panoramic Views from Portrait Shots</h3>
      <p>Turn a vertical photo into a dramatic horizontal panorama. The AI extends the landscape on both sides, continuing mountains, coastlines, city skylines, or whatever environment your original captures. This is particularly effective with landscape and nature photography, where the extended elements (sky, terrain, vegetation) follow natural patterns that the AI handles well.</p>

      <h3>Add Breathing Room for Design</h3>
      <p>Designers often need images with negative space for text placement, logo positioning, or layout requirements. Image expansion creates that space organically, extending the background so you have room for headlines, call-to-action buttons, or other design elements without covering the main subject.</p>

      <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
      <p>Here is how to expand an image using FP AI Studio:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Open FP AI Studio</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Image Editing</strong> section.</li>
        <li><strong>Select the Expand tool</strong> from the available editing options.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide your source image URL.</strong> This is the image you want to expand.</li>
        <li><strong>Write an expansion prompt.</strong> Describe what you want in the expanded area. For example: "continue the forest scene with similar trees and dappled sunlight" or "extend the sky with matching sunset colors and clouds."</li>
        <li><strong>Tap Process</strong> and wait for Flux Pro to generate the expanded image.</li>
        <li><strong>Review the result.</strong> If the expansion does not look right, try adjusting your prompt to be more specific about what you want in the extended area.</li>
        <li><strong>Download or share</strong> your expanded image directly from the app.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="creative-applications">Creative Applications</h2>
      <p>Beyond practical use cases, image expansion opens up creative possibilities that were previously difficult or impossible:</p>

      <h3>Reveal Hidden Worlds</h3>
      <p>Take a close-up photo and expand it to reveal an imaginary surrounding environment. A macro shot of a flower could expand to reveal a fantasy garden. A portrait could expand to place the subject in an entirely different setting. Use descriptive prompts to guide the AI toward your creative vision.</p>

      <h3>Create Triptychs and Multi-Panel Art</h3>
      <p>Start with a central image and expand it on both sides to create a three-panel composition. Each panel continues the scene but adds new elements, creating a narrative flow from left to right. This technique works beautifully for wall art and gallery prints.</p>

      <h3>Extend AI-Generated Images</h3>
      <p>Generate an image using FP AI Studio's text-to-image feature, then expand it for a wider composition. This is especially useful when the initial generation has a great subject but you want more environmental context around it. The expansion will match the style and quality of the original AI generation seamlessly.</p>

      <h3>Build Scrolling Backgrounds</h3>
      <p>For video editors and motion designers, expanded images make excellent scrolling backgrounds. Generate or photograph a scene, expand it to an ultra-wide aspect ratio, and use a slow pan across it in your video project for a parallax or establishing shot effect.</p>

      <h2 id="tips-seamless">Tips for Seamless Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be specific in your prompt.</strong> The more detail you provide about what should appear in the expanded area, the more coherent the result. "Continue the sandy beach with gentle waves and clear blue water" produces much better results than no prompt at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Match the original style.</strong> If your source image has a specific quality (film grain, warm color grade, shallow depth of field), mention these characteristics in your prompt so the expanded area matches.</li>
        <li><strong>Expand gradually for large extensions.</strong> If you need to double or triple the image width, consider expanding in stages rather than all at once. Each expansion step gives the AI more context from the previous expansion to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple backgrounds expand best.</strong> Images with uniform or gradually changing backgrounds (sky, water, grass, studio backdrops) produce the most seamless expansions. Highly complex scenes with many distinct objects are harder for the AI to extend convincingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine with upscaling.</strong> After expanding, run the result through FP AI Studio's upscaler to ensure the entire image (original and expanded areas) is at maximum resolution and sharpness.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the seam area.</strong> Look closely at where the original image meets the expanded content. In most cases, the transition is invisible, but occasionally you may notice slight inconsistencies. If this happens, try adjusting your prompt or regenerating.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AI image expansion is one of those tools that, once you start using it, you find applications for everywhere. It solves the constant frustration of having great photos in the wrong format, and it unlocks creative possibilities that simply did not exist before generative AI. Whether you are a marketer needing banners, a photographer fixing compositions, or an artist exploring new creative directions, the Expand tool in FP AI Studio puts this capability at your fingertips.</p>
