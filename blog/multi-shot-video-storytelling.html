      <h2 id="what-is-multishot">What Is Multi-Shot Video?</h2>
      <p>Traditional AI video generation creates a single continuous shot from one prompt. Multi-shot video changes the game entirely. Instead of generating one scene, you can define <strong>up to 6 separate scenes</strong>, each with its own prompt and duration, and the AI generates them as a single cohesive video. This transforms AI video from a single-clip tool into a genuine <strong>storytelling engine</strong>.</p>
      <p>Think of it like a storyboard that comes to life. Each scene is a different shot &mdash; an establishing wide shot, a close-up of a character, an action sequence, a reaction shot &mdash; and the AI stitches them together into one seamless video. This is the closest thing to directing a short film with AI.</p>

      <h2 id="supported-models">Supported Models &amp; Settings</h2>
      <p>Multi-shot generation is available on two models in FP AI Studio: <strong>Kling V3 Pro</strong> and <strong>Kling V3 Omni</strong>. Both models share the same multi-shot capabilities with these settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Up to 6 scenes</strong> per video</li>
        <li><strong>Per-scene prompts</strong> &mdash; Each scene gets its own 2-3 line text prompt</li>
        <li><strong>Per-scene duration</strong> &mdash; Each scene can be 3 to 15 seconds</li>
        <li><strong>Total maximum duration</strong> &mdash; 15 seconds across all scenes combined</li>
        <li><strong>Aspect ratios</strong> &mdash; 16:9 (landscape), 9:16 (portrait), 1:1 (square)</li>
        <li><strong>CFG scale</strong> &mdash; 0 to 2, controlling how closely the output follows your prompt</li>
        <li><strong>Character element support</strong> &mdash; Use @Element1 tags with reference images for consistent characters</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Audio toggle</strong> &mdash; AI-generated sound effects and ambient audio</li>
        <li><strong>Start/end frame images</strong> &mdash; Provide reference images for the opening and closing frames</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="planning">Planning Your Multi-Shot Video</h2>
      <p>The key to great multi-shot video is planning before you generate. Since you have a maximum of 15 seconds total and up to 6 scenes, you need to be strategic about how you allocate time and scenes.</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Define Your Story</h3>
      <p>Start with a simple narrative arc. What is the beginning, middle, and end? Even a 15-second video can tell a compelling micro-story if each scene serves a clear purpose.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Decide Scene Count</h3>
      <p>Fewer scenes with longer durations create a more cinematic feel. More scenes with shorter durations create a fast-paced, dynamic video. A good starting point is 3 scenes at 5 seconds each, using the full 15-second budget.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Allocate Durations</h3>
      <p>Remember, every scene must be at least 3 seconds and the total cannot exceed 15 seconds. If you use 6 scenes, the average is 2.5 seconds each &mdash; but since the minimum is 3 seconds, you would need to limit some scenes to 3 seconds while giving others slightly less. In practice, 4-5 scenes is a sweet spot that balances variety with sufficient duration per shot.</p>

      <h2 id="scene-prompting">Scene-by-Scene Prompting</h2>
      <p>Each scene in a multi-shot video gets its own dedicated prompt of 2-3 lines. This is where you describe what happens in that specific shot. The prompt should focus on the <strong>action, camera angle, and mood</strong> for that particular scene.</p>
      <p>Unlike single-shot prompts that describe an entire video, multi-shot scene prompts should be tightly focused. Each prompt controls only its own scene, so you can vary camera angles, settings, and actions between shots.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scene 1 prompt:</strong> Focus on establishing the setting and introducing the subject</li>
        <li><strong>Middle scene prompts:</strong> Focus on action, events, or progression</li>
        <li><strong>Final scene prompt:</strong> Focus on resolution, reveal, or climax</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Write each prompt as if describing a single shot in a movie. Include camera direction ("close-up of," "wide shot showing," "camera pans left to reveal") for more cinematic results.</p>

      <h2 id="character-elements">Character Consistency with Elements</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges in multi-shot video is keeping characters looking the same across scenes. Kling V3 solves this with <strong>character elements</strong>. You provide a reference image of your character and assign it an element tag (such as @Element1). Then, in any scene prompt where that character appears, you include the @Element1 tag to reference the same character.</p>
      <p>This tells the AI to use the reference image as a guide for that character's appearance in every scene where the tag is used. The result is a consistent character across different shots, angles, and settings &mdash; something that was nearly impossible with traditional single-shot generation.</p>
      <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Upload a clear reference image of your character (face clearly visible, good lighting). Add it as an element. Then include @Element1 in the scene prompts where that character should appear. For example: "@Element1 walks through a busy marketplace, looking at colorful fabrics."</p>

      <h2 id="duration-management">Duration Management</h2>
      <p>The 15-second total constraint is the most important limitation to understand. Here are practical duration distributions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3 scenes:</strong> 5s + 5s + 5s (balanced), or 3s + 5s + 7s (building intensity)</li>
        <li><strong>4 scenes:</strong> 3s + 4s + 4s + 4s, or 3s + 3s + 4s + 5s</li>
        <li><strong>5 scenes:</strong> 3s + 3s + 3s + 3s + 3s (maximum scenes at minimum duration)</li>
        <li><strong>6 scenes:</strong> You will need most at 3 seconds (the minimum), giving a rapid-cut style</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Longer scenes (5+ seconds) work best for establishing shots and emotional moments. Shorter scenes (3 seconds) work well for action beats, quick reactions, and montage-style sequences.</p>

      <h2 id="audio-generation">Audio Generation</h2>
      <p>Both Kling V3 Pro and Kling V3 Omni offer a <strong>Generate Audio</strong> toggle. When enabled, the AI generates ambient sound effects and audio that matches the visual content of your video. This adds significant production value to your multi-shot videos, especially for storytelling where sound design enhances the narrative.</p>
      <p>The audio generation analyzes the visual content and creates appropriate sounds &mdash; footsteps for walking scenes, ambient noise for outdoor environments, and atmospheric sound for dramatic moments. For multi-shot videos, the audio transitions naturally between scenes.</p>

      <h2 id="practical-examples">Practical Story Examples</h2>
      <h3>3-Shot Example: Coffee Shop Morning</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scene 1 (5s):</strong> "Wide shot of a cozy coffee shop exterior at dawn, warm light glowing from inside, gentle steam rising from the chimney, soft morning light"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 2 (5s):</strong> "Close-up of a barista's hands pouring latte art into a ceramic cup, smooth circular motion, creamy foam forming a leaf pattern, warm lighting"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 3 (5s):</strong> "@Element1 sits by the window, takes a sip of coffee, smiles contentedly while watching rain begin to fall outside, cozy atmosphere"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6-Shot Example: Urban Chase Sequence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scene 1 (3s):</strong> "Wide establishing shot of a neon-lit city street at night, puddles reflecting colorful signs"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 2 (3s):</strong> "@Element1 bursts through a door into an alley, running at full speed, coat flying behind them"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 3 (3s):</strong> "Low angle tracking shot of feet running across wet pavement, splashing through puddles"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 4 (3s):</strong> "@Element1 slides around a corner, glancing back over their shoulder, neon lights reflecting on their face"</li>
        <li><strong>Scene 5 (3s):</strong> "Aerial drone shot looking down at the figure running through a narrow market alley, stalls on both sides"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="transition-tips">Tips for Smooth Transitions</h2>
      <p>While the AI handles transitions between scenes automatically, you can improve the flow by following these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintain visual continuity.</strong> If scene 1 ends in a dark alley, scene 2 should not suddenly start in bright sunlight unless that is an intentional effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Use camera direction for flow.</strong> If scene 1 has a camera moving right, starting scene 2 with motion from the left creates a natural cut.</li>
        <li><strong>Vary shot types deliberately.</strong> Alternate between wide, medium, and close-up shots to create visual rhythm. Avoid using the same shot type for consecutive scenes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use start and end frame images.</strong> Providing a start frame for the first scene and an end frame for the last scene anchors your visual narrative with specific reference images.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust CFG scale.</strong> A CFG scale closer to 2 makes the output follow your prompts more strictly, which is helpful for multi-shot where scene consistency matters. Lower values (closer to 0) allow more creative freedom but may reduce scene-to-scene coherence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multi-shot video generation on Kling V3 Pro and Kling V3 Omni transforms FP AI Studio into a genuine short-form video production tool. With up to 6 scenes, character elements for consistency, per-scene duration control, and AI audio generation, you have everything you need to tell complete visual stories &mdash; all from a single generation.</p>
